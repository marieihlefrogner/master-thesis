    abstract = { Background and Purpose—To assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their clinical correlates, and the effects of depressive symptoms on stroke recovery, a relatively unselected, well-diagnosed cohort of consecutive stroke survivors was followed prospectively. Methods—Consecutive admissions to a regional stroke center who met World Health Organization and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria for stroke were eligible. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain stem strokes were excluded. Patients underwent CT, single-photon emission CT, and standardized neurological and cognitive examinations at entry. At 3 months and 1 year after stroke, depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Functional outcome was measured with the Functional Independence Measure, and handicap was assessed by the Oxford Handicap Scale. Results—We assessed 436 patients at entry (mean±SD age, 74.9±11.6 years). There were 150 patients available for assessment at 3 months and 136 at 1 year. Marked depressive symptoms were noted in 22\% (SDS) to 27\% (MADRS) at 3 months and 21\% (SDS) to 22\% (MADRS) at 1 year. Patents with marked depressive symptoms had more neurological impairment (P\&lt;.008), were more likely to be female (P\&lt;.05), and were more likely to have previous histories of depression (P\&lt;.03). There was no relationship between depressive symptoms and age, lesion volume, or side of lesion. Depressive symptoms were correlated with functional outcome (r=−.31, P\&lt;.0001) and handicap (r=.41, P\&lt;.0001) at 3 months and 1 year (r=−.28, P\&lt;.001; r=.35, P\&lt;.0001). Conclusions—Depressive symptoms and functional outcome are correlated. In view of the prevalence of depressive symptoms in this population, diagnosis and treatment of depression are important in optimizing recovery. }

In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient-doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.},

    abstract={Personal and ubiquitous sensing technologies such as smartphones have allowed the continuous collection of data in an unobtrusive manner. Machine learning methods have been applied to continuous sensor data to predict user contextual information such as location, mood, physical activity, etc. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging ubiquitous sensing technologies for mental health care applications, thus, allowing the automatic continuous monitoring of different mental conditions such as depression, anxiety, stress, and so on. This paper surveys recent research works in mental health monitoring systems (MHMS) using sensor data and machine learning. We focused on research works about mental disorders/conditions such as: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, stress, etc. We propose a classification taxonomy to guide the review of related works and present the overall phases of MHMS. Moreover, research challenges in the field and future opportunities are also discussed.}

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Wearable sensors measuring different parts of people's activity are a common technology nowadays. Data created using these devices holds a lot of potential besides measuring the quantity of daily steps or calories burned, since continuous recordings of heart rate and activity levels usually are collected. Furthermore, there is an increasing awareness in the field of psychiatry on how these activity data relates to various mental health issues such as changes in mood, personality, inability to cope with daily problems or stress and withdrawal from friends and activities. In this paper we present the analysis of a unique dataset containing sensor data collected from patients suffering from depression. The dataset contains motor activity recordings of 23 unipolar and bipolar depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. We apply machine learning to classify patients into depressed and nondepressed. For evaluation of the algorithms, leave one patient out validation is performed. The best results achieved are an F1 score of 0.73 and a MCC of 0.44. The overall findings show that sensor data contains information that can be used to determine the depression status of a person.},

Nevertheless, datasets containing sensor data in the field of medicine are rare. Often, data is non-public and only results are published. This makes it hard for other researchers to reproduce and compare results or even collaborate. In this paper we present a unique dataset containing sensor data collected from patients suffering from depression. The dataset contains motor activity recordings of 23 unipolar and bipolar depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. For each patient we provide sensor data over several days of continuous measuring and also some demographic data. The severity of the patients' depressive state was labeled using ratings done by medical experts on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). In this respect, the here presented dataset can be useful to explore and understand the association between depression and motor activity better. By making this dataset available, we invite and enable interested researchers the possibility to tackle this challenging and important societal problem.},

Objective smartphone data reflecting illness activity could facilitate early treatment and act as outcome in efficacy trials. A total of 29 patients with BD presenting with moderate to severe levels of depressive and manic symptoms used a smartphone-based self-monitoring system during 12 weeks. Objective smartphone data on behavioral activities were collected. Symptoms were clinically assessed every second week using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Objective smartphone data correlated with symptom severity. The more severe the depressive symptoms (1) the longer the smartphone's screen was “on”/day, (2) more received incoming calls/day, (3) fewer outgoing calls/day were made, (4) less answered incoming calls/day, (5) the patients moved less between cell towers IDs/day. Conversely, the more severe the manic symptoms (1) more outgoing text messages/day sent, (2) the phone calls/day were longer, (3) the fewer number of characters in incoming text messages/day, (4) the lower duration of outgoing calls/day, (5) the patients moved more between cell towers IDs/day. Further, objective smartphone data were able to discriminate between affective states. Objective smartphone data reflect illness severity, discriminates between affective states in BD and may facilitate the cooperation between patient and clinician.

@article{maxhuni2016,
    abstract = {There is growing amount of scientific evidence that motor activity is the most consistent indicator of bipolar disorder. Motor activity includes several areas such as body movement, motor response time, level of psychomotor activity, and speech related motor activity. Studies of motor activity in bipolar disorder have typically used self-reported questionnaires with clinical observer-rated scales, which are therefore subjective and have often limited effectiveness. Motor activity information can be used to classify episode type in bipolar patients, which is highly relevant, since severe depression and manic states can result in mortality. This paper introduces a system able to classify the state of patients suffering from bipolar disorder using sensed information from smartphones. We collected audio, accelerometer and self-assessment data from five patients over a time-period of 12 weeks during their real-life activities. In this research we evaluated the performance of several classifiers, different sets of features and the role of the questionnaires for classifying bipolar disorder episodes. In particular, we have shown that it is possible to classify with high confidence (≈85{\%}) the course of mood episodes or relapse in bipolar patients. To our knowledge, no research to date has focused on naturalistic observation of day-to-day phone conversation to classify impaired life functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder.},

@article{instagram_depression,
    abstract = { Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools to successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners' average diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed.  Photos posted by depressed individuals were more likely to be bluer, grayer, and darker.  Human ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with computationallygenerated features. These findings suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness. Significance statement: Photographs posted to Instagram can be analyzed using computational methods to screen for depression. Using only photographic details, such as color and brightness, our statistical model was able to predict which study participants suffered from depression, and performed better than the rate at which unassisted general practitioners typically perform during inperson patient assessments. Markers of depression were evident in Instagram posts even when only including posts made before the date of first depression diagnosis. These findings demonstrate how visual social media may be harnessed to make accurate inferences about mental health.},
