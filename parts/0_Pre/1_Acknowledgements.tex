I would like to thank PÃ¥l Halvorsen and Michael Riegler for being my supervisors. Their feedback and tips have been essential for the success of my thesis.

Thanks to the developers of Grammarly. Their software has kept my writing at a decent level.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for motivating me and always believing in me. It has been difficult at times to stay focused on a large project like this.

My inner circle at IFI deserves a special thanks. We have been pushing each other through everything since day one, and we have now finished five years of education together.
