- Mental health monitoring with multimodal sensing and machine learning
	- E. Garcia-Ceja et al. surveyed recent research works in the field of Mental Health Monitoring Systems (MHMS). 
	- Data is available from many different sensor sources (smart-devices, etc.)
	- Usages of sensor data include information about physical activity, location, mood, social relationships
	- Different sensor types/devices
	- Different study types


- O'Brien, J.T. et al.  
	- Association - depresstheion
	- 7 days
	- Wearable (wrist accelerometer)
	- 29 adults with depression, 30 healthy. > 60 years
	- Reduced physical activity in condition group

- Faurholt-Jepsen, M. et al. 
	- Association - bipolar disorder
	- 12 weeks
	- Wearable (smartphone) - sms, calls, screen, location
	- 29 bipolar patients
	- Found correlations between bipolar states severity and screen time, number of calls/day, cell tower ids.

- Gr√ºnerbl, A. et al.
	- Detection - bipolar disorder
	- 12 weeks
	- Wearable (smartphone) - phone logs, microphone
	- 10 bipolar patients (18-68 years)
	- 76% average recognition accuracy with Naive Bayes and 97% recall in state change detection

	- Detection - bipolar disorder
   	- 12 weeks
	- Wearable (smartphone) - accelerometer, GPS
 	- 10 bipolar patients (18-68 years)
	- State change detection recall 94% and state recognition 80% accuracy with Naive Bayes

- Maxhuni, A. et al.
	- Detection - bipolar disorder
   	- 12 weeks
	- Wearable (smartphone) - accelerometer, microphone, questionnaires
	- 10 bipolar patients (18-68 years)
	- 85% classification accuracy with Bagging

- Andrew G. et al.
	- Forecasting/detection - depression
	- Short-term
	- Social Media - instagram photos
	- 71 viable participants (19-55 years)
	- Correctly identified 70% of all depressed cases with Random Forest
